# PIProject

Congratulations you're on your way to being an amazing programmer, coder, software engineer, whatever you want to do with computers.

Your going to create a pokemon battle text story. I've started it for you and given you some basis, but feel free to go whatever direction you'd like with this!
To get started copy and paste the code from "pokemon_battle_project.py" in to https://repl.it/languages/python3


If you've finished the basic code and want a challenge:
You can make it that the pokemon you are battling has HP (health points), 
you can then have you attacks do different amount of damange (ex. Thrash does 15 damage, Stomp does 20 damage)
now you can have an enemy HP variable, and subtract the amount of damage each attack does depending on what attack is done
and the battle does not end till the opponent's HP is below 10!
